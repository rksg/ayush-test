# rc-common-components

This library provides reusable React components shared across the components packages such as `rc-components`, `wifi-components`, and `switch-components`.
It is intended for internal use within these component libraries and should not be imported directly by apps (e.g. `main`, `rc`) or `main-components`.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test rc-common-components` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
