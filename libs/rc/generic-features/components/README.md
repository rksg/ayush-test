# rc-generic-features-components

This library provides reusable React components shared across the generic features packages.

It is intended for internal use within these apps and `main-components` and should not be imported directly by components such as `rc-components`, `wifi-components`, and `switch-components`.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test rc-generic-features-components` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
