# to unset all previously defined code owners of the files.                                #
# e.g. devops group wants to review everything under ci (as defined above),                #

# Defining local groups in this file for this repo
# restriction will be at bitbucket level per group enforcement

# Fallback to allow other users to approve pull requests in case Code Owners are not available (eg. holidays)
#  1. Define a group with the special name `FallbackOwners` and add the people which can approve PRs for other Code Owners.
#  2. In case a Code Owner is absent and the PR can not be merged because of a missing Code Owner approval, add extra reviewers from the FallbackOwners group to the PR. Any approval of such an extra reviewer counts towards any Code Owners merge check.
