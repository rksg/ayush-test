The benefit of this option is that Service Validation tests for the non-wireless portion of the network (e.g. DHCP, RADIUS, DNS, etc.) can be simultaneously tested quickly over a large number of APs with no impact on existing WiFi services.</p> <p>For the Virtual Wireless Client option, there will be actual RF transmissions over the air. For every target AP to be tested, a corresponding \"station AP\" will be selected. The station AP is a neigbouring AP with the best signal strength, and during the test, this station AP will behave as a station (i.e. a WiFi client) and wirelessly connect to the target AP, just like a regular WiFi client, for the test. The benefit of this option is that the Service Validation test will comprehensively cover both the wireless and wired portion of the network. However, during this test, the station AP may need to switch its operating channel to be the same as the target AP. This change in channel may cause some disruptions to the end user WiFi experience (e.g. during video calls).
