          Root Cause Analysis
        </h4>
        <p>
          Clients are failing at the authentication stage of an 802.11r (Fast Transition) roam. The client is including PMKID information from its roam-from AP, but the roam-to AP does not have the key. 
          <br />
          <br />
           This scenario is most commonly caused in the following scenarios:
        </p>
         
        <ol>
           
          <li>
            The roam-from and roam-to APs cannot share keys with one another, which happens if they are not RF neighbors or if they do not have IP connectivity for AP-to-AP communication.
          </li>
           
          <li>
            The roam-from and roam-to APs are not RF neighbors. Clients may assume that all APs sharing an SSID will have the key, but the key may only be shared with RF neighbors.
          </li>
           
        </ol>

          Recommended Action
        </h4>
        <p>
          In most cases, clients will immediately fall back to a "slow roam" if 802.11r (FT) roams fail. 
          <br />
          <br />
           To enable 802.11r roaming, make sure that APs are able to communicate with their RF neighbors via the IP (wired) infrastructure.
